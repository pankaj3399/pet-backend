express.urlencoded(): This is a built-in middleware function provided by the Express.js framework. It is used to parse incoming request bodies containing URL-encoded form data. When included in the middleware chain using app.use(), it parses the req object's body as URL-encoded data and exposes the resulting key-value pairs on req.body.

{ extended: true, limit: "16kb" }: These are options passed to the express.urlencoded() middleware function.
extended: true: This option specifies whether the URL-encoded data parser should use the querystring library (querystring) or the more modern qs library to parse the URL-encoded data. When set to true, the parser uses the qs library, allowing for richer functionality such as nested objects and arrays in form data. If set to false, the parser uses the querystring library, which is simpler and more traditional. Setting it to true enables support for parsing nested objects and arrays, but it also makes parsing slightly more complex.

limit: "16kb": This option specifies the maximum size of the URL-encoded form data that the middleware will accept and parse. If the request body exceeds this limit, the middleware will generate an error response. The value "16kb" indicates that the limit is set to 16 kilobytes. You can adjust this value according to your application's needs.
